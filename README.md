# maru-website

I'm working on making my own personal website to showcase what I've been working on in my free time and what I've accomplished in my undergraduate years at the Univeristy of Toronto! 

The website uses ReactJs, Material UI and Styled Components, alongside other front end react libraries to help me develop this website. 

The website can be found at https://www.marujeyakumar.com, hosted with AWS Amplify.

1. Troubleshoot redirect issues with https://marujeyakumar.com [IN PROGRESS]

4. Finalize styles and color theme [NOT BEGUN]

3. Add webhook to github repo to deploy using AWS Amplify 
4. Set up SSL certificates to domain 
5. Set up redirects 
6. Fix issues with build by editing the build script. It was empty before so nothing was builing.
